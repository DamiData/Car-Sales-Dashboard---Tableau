   - Standardizing date formats.
 

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. **Initial Data Exploration:**
   - Summary statistics of key variables.
   - Identifying trends, patterns in the data.

2. **Visual Analysis:**
   - Creating initial visualizations to understand data distribution and relationships.

### Visualization in Tableau
1. **Building KPIs:**
   - Creating calculated fields for dynamic KPIs.
   - Designing KPI cards for dashboard display.

2. **Creating Charts:**
   - Line Chart for YTD Sales Weekly Trend.
   - Pie Chart for YTD Total Sales by Body Style.
   - Donut Chart for YTD Total Sales by Color.
   - Bar Chart for YTD Cars Sold by Dealer Region.
   - Tabular Grid for Company-Wise Sales Trend.




### Problem Statement 1: KPIs Requirement
The dashboard should provide real-time insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) related to our sales data. This will enable us to make informed decisions, monitor our progress, and identify trends and opportunities for growth.


1. **Sales Overview:**
   - Year-to-Date (YTD) Total Sales
   - Year-over-Year (YOY) Growth in Total Sales

2. **Average Price Analysis:**
   - YTD Average Price
   - YOY Growth in Average Price

3. **Cars Sold Metrics:**
   - YTD Cars Sold
   - YOY Growth in Cars Sold

### Problem Statement 2: Charts Requirement

1. **YTD Sales Weekly Trend:** Display a line chart illustrating the weekly trend of YTD sales. The X-axis should represent weeks, and the Y-axis should show the total sales amount.
2. **YTD Total Sales by Body Style:** Visualize the distribution of YTD total sales across different car body styles using a Pie chart.
3. **YTD Total Sales by Color:** Present the contribution of various car colors to the YTD total sales through a donut chart.
4. **YTD Cars Sold by Dealer Region:** Showcase the YTD sales data based on different dealer regions using a bar chart to visualize the sales distribution geographically.
5. **Company-Wise Sales Trend in Grid Form:** Provide a tabular grid that displays the sales trend for each company. The grid should showcase the company name along with their YTD sales figures.

### Solution
- **YTD Total Sales:** Current year total sales. To make it dynamic in nature, it must be a calculated field in Tableau.
